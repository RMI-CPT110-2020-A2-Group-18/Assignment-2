<br>
<strong style="font-size:150%;">What does it do?</strong>
<br>
<p style="font-size:150%;">As the name suggest, it’s a vehicle (cars mostly) that has a high degree of autonomy. This means that the vehicle can move from place to place without the need for a human to operate the vehicle. The Society of Autonomous Engineering (SAE) have 5 levels of driving autonomy, where level 0 is basically no automation of any kind and level 5 is fully automated driving (SAE International Releases Updated Visual Chart for Its “Levels of Driving Automation” Standard for Self-Driving Vehicles, 2020). Most manufactures that develop autonomous vehicles are at level 4 which the level states that the autonomous vehicles can drive safely in ideal conditions whereas level states that the autonomous vehicle can drive in any condition with relative safety (What is an Autonomous Car? – How Self-Driving Cars Work | Synopsys, 2020).  This is the general idea of what autonomous vehicles are but how exactly do they achieve their autonomy? The most common method that different manufactures are utilizing for autonomous vehicles is to use a combination of sensors, cameras, radar, machine learning, neural networks and AI in order to capture and process the necessary information for the vehicle to take its route. However, not all manufactures that are developing autonomous vehicles are making them function the same way. Take the most well known example tesla, their cars use 8 cameras for 360 degree view, 12 ultrasonic sensors for close range detection and a forward facing radar with max detection of 160 metres as well giving the car the ability to navigate through heavy dust,rain and/or fog. In addition to this its autopilot software is built on a deep neural network that utilizes data from previous models as well as constantly sharing data with the tesla fleet, it uses this to allow its neural network to ‘mature’ and enable it to make nuisance decisions in response to the sensory data that is processed by the on board computer. With all these devices and the neural network it is built on, the tesla autonomous vehicle drives itself by looking ahead of and around itself and processes the data as it moves. It mainly focuses on itself and collision detection when it drives. To contrast, waymo(Google’s version of an autonomous vehicle) develops a 3D map based on the route to its destination and uses Light Detection And Ranging(LIDAR) to create a dynamic 3D map of the cars current position then uses this to interact with the 3D map that was created at the start of the journey(Technology – Waymo, 2020). Also, the AI that handles the data processing can also perform movement predictions of other moving objects such as cars, bikes, pedestrians etc. So, waymo drives itself based on the interaction between a 3D map of its route and 3D model of where it currently is, also it doesn’t just have collision detection like tesla,it predicts where other moving objects will go and change where it will go based off that. Moreover, autonomous vehicles can many things such as drive itself, park itself and bring itself to you when you want to go somewhere. Yet, as it was mentioned earlier, most of these vehicles are only operating on a level 4 of driving autonomy where they can only drive well in ideal conditions. The next big thing for autonomous vehicles is to get them to level 5 for driving autonomy. One of the main problems that autonomous vehicles are facing besides technological restraints of cameras and sensors is neural networks. Neural networks are essential to autonomous vehicles because it acts like experience for the AI and helps It make more nuanced responses. However, it takes weeks and tons of computational power to train neural networks for use. Waymo teaming up DeepMind to try make this process more efficient and effective, particularly in how the AI detects object and what identify it as.

<strong style="font-size:150%;">What is the likely impact?</strong>
<br>
<p style="font-size:150%;">One of the biggest impacts that autonomous vehicles will have is on car crash fatalities. It was estimated by NHTSA in 2017 37,150 people died in car accidents in the US and that it was also estimated that 94% accidents were brought on by human error such drunkenness and driver distractions (What are Self-Driving Cars and How Do They Work?, 2020).However, the implementation of autonomous vehicles will remove the element of human error and is estimated to reduce car crash fatalities by 90% within the next 30 years(LaFrance, 2020).Another huge impact autonomous vehicles will have is disrupting traditional ownership and sale of vehicles as it is estimated that by 2030, 95% of a persons commuting will be done in a autonomous share-vehicle with other commuters. (Why hardly anyone will own a car in 2030, 2020). This will also affect other things such as car insurance, car parks, and car manufactures that are not selling autonomous vehicles. Additionally, autonomous vehicles are expected to be greatly beneficial to the elderly and people with mobility issues as it will help overcome their inability to travel by car. (6 surprising ways driverless cars will change our world, 2020). Moreover, autonomous vehicles will be very disruptive when it gets implemented and will affect everyone in a significant way. However, it will affect some more than other and those people are most likely going to be non-autonomous car manufactures/dealerships and people with mobility issues such the elderly as they can not drive once they pass a certain age but need the convince of transport by car more than ever in their old age. As for how autonomous vehicles will affect jobs, its estimated that truck drivers will be one of the first jobs to be fully automated as truck drivers tend to drive on less complex and long highways which are very ideal conditions autonomous vehicles. However, it is also said that new jobs will spring up in its place but most of the jobs engineering base for now. (Reinicke, 2020)</p>

<strong style="font-size:150%;">How will this affect me?</strong>
<br>
<p style="font-size:150%;">I think autonomous vehicles would be greatly beneficial for me. It would be a great convenience to be able to relax in a car as it takes you to your destination whether that would be work, school, shopping etc. It would be great for going to the city as one of the biggest problems or at least for me, whenever I go to the city, finding a parking spot close to where I have to go and in less than 20 minutes never seems possible. But with an autonomous vehicle I would not have to worry about finding a parking spot as I could just get out of and let another person near me hail the autonomous vehicle and then I could do the same thing for when I want  to leave, so it is very handy in those kinds of situations. It could also take me home when I get too drunk and I would not have to worry being messed with or robbed when I pass out because there is no driver their to do that because it is driver less. Moreover, one of the biggest changes autonomous vehicles would make for me is that I would be willing to live much further away from the city. This is because the worst part about living further from the city is spending way too much time in traffic to and from work. However, if I do not have to constantly put a conscious effort into driving and that I could instead watch videos or sleep during my commute to and from work then I would live as far as Newcastle. I think this would be great for my brothers because they like going out and getting blind a lot and my mon would really like because she does not know how to drive but she does all the shopping and usually has to wait until someone is free to take her shopping.</p>
