<p style="font-size:150%;">My idea of what my ideal job is has changed after seeing the Burning Glass data. This is because I wasn’t fully aware of how much some jobs were much more in demand than others e.g. the number 1 demanded position is software engineer which had 29,456 postings on roughly a 1-year-period. To contrast, the second most demanded position was computer systems engineer and it only had 13,111 postings over the same period, its total job posting only made up roughly 45% of software engineering’s total postings. Overall, seeing this data has swayed me more towards IT-engineering type of jobs and this is mostly because these jobs, particularly software engineer, have an enormous amount of demand for them and this naturally means they are easy jobs to get if you meet the standard qualifications and they pay a lot of money.</p>
